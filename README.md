# Hurricane Analysis Project

## Overview

The Hurricane Analysis project is designed to organize and manipulate data about Category 5 hurricanes. By using Python's dictionaries and lists, the project provides insights into the most powerful hurricanes in the Atlantic region.

## Project Goals

- Convert hurricane damage data into a consistent format.
- Organize hurricane data into dictionaries for easy access.
- Analyze data to find patterns and insights, such as the most affected areas and the deadliest hurricanes.

## Features

1. **Data Conversion**: Convert damage data from strings to float values for easy calculations.
2. **Data Organization**: Create dictionaries to store hurricane data by name and year.
3. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Count how often each area is affected by hurricanes.
   - Identify the area affected by the most hurricanes.
   - Find the deadliest hurricane.
   - Rate hurricanes based on mortality and damage.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for local development)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `Hurricane Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook or script to execute the analysis.
